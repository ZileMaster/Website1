# First Website

It's still running on : https://portfolio-site1389.netlify.app/

So, my first serious project i done from scratch by myself(not counting using the create-react-app because i was lazy), it was a rollercoaster! And i loved it! It still has some problems, and will forever have them, the reason i never worked anything more on it is that i had in reality no idea how the Backend and Frontend worked, and i had this taught that it can all just go on the front(thank you node.js and rails for enlightening me!) But, as a project that's built fully by me im so proud of it, and will also forever be, it's slow, like really slow(i packed almost half a gigabite of pictures on it) and that's what fumed me the most. The biggest problem i had here was the CSS honestly, i modify 1 line and in another page it breaks everything! I should have used bootstrap but i was ignorant and stuborn to make it work, and in the end it works(kinda). Nonetheless it was extremely fun building it, and the more important part is that it helped make studying and learning fun for me as well! 
I learned concepts here as well, and they are never use photos on the page without backend because it's a pain to put them in the code nonstop and it will be so slowwww, next to that i learned that i can't make create-react-apps in infinity and this was also the last create-react-app i made, after i actually made them from scratch. Reusing components, encorporating mass css in one and much more did i learn on this spectacular project! 

Hope you like it reader!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
